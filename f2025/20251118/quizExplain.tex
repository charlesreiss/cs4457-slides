    \begin{itemize}
    \item had potential for Date / max-age disagreement
    \item I had assumed: need to worry about missync'd clock
    \item RFC 9111 algorithm (not mandatory):
    \item age at reception = max of
        \begin{itemize}
        \item received time - date header value (if ``implementation's clock reasonablye well synchornized to origin server's clock'')
        \item received time - requested time + `Age' header (if present)
        \end{itemize}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item this reverse proxy would be the HTTP server for quux.com
        \item idea of reverse proxies: translate requests to another HTTP server
        \item going to look like normal requests to that other HTTP server

    \begin{itemize}
        \item meant to write waits `100 microseconds \textit{after previous transmission ends}'
        \item omitting that text means a lot of weird probability figuring
            \begin{itemize}
                \item (and this isn't a probability course)
            \end{itemize}
