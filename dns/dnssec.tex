\begin{frame}{DNSSEC}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item public key infrastructure for DNS
    \item single set of root keys from ICANN/IANA
        \begin{itemize}
        \item no certificate authorities like web PKI
        \end{itemize}
    \item each DNS zone has its own public key
    \item all records within zone have a signature
    \item delegation records have keys for subzones
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{digital signature}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item generate (public key, private key) such that
    \item Sign(private key, message) = signature
    \item Verify(public key, signature, message) = 1
    \item and it's really hard to generate $X$ s.t. \\
        Verify(public key, $X$, signature) = 1 \\
        if you don't know the private key
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item distribute public key widely
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{DNSSEC offline signing}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item design goal: generate + sign zone
    \item have digital signatures that can verify all records
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item means: DNS servers don't need to actually sign anything!
    \item can have signing keys offline
        \begin{itemize}
        \item much lower security risk
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
