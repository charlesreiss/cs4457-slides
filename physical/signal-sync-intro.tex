\begin{frame}{self-synchronizing?}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item can resynchronize clock by looking for transitions
    \item but doesn't work if lots of consecutive 0s or 1s
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item also, need to know where low and high point is
    \item important to have transitions to low/high to calibrate this
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{self-sync and `start-message'}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item one idea: set start-message to have lots of 0/1/0/1/0/1/0/1/etc.
        \begin{itemize}
        \item something 10Mbit Ethernet does
        \end{itemize}
    \item but probably not enough to ensure things stay in sync on big message
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item alternate strategy --- use encoding that adds extra transitions
    \item example: Manchester encoding
    \end{itemize}
