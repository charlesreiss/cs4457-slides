    Queue of events sorted by time and the latest event being pulled from the queue. The event pulled out of the queue
    is represented by a tuple of a time and an action. Running the action uses and updates a network state.
    Running the action yields new events, which are added back to the event queue, and outputs like packet traces
    and counters.

\begin{frame}{action example 1}
\begin{itemize}
    \item take next packet from send queue for link X
    \item compute whether packet is lost due to error
    \item compute when packet is done transmitting
        \begin{itemize}
        \item schedule new event to handle next packet in queue at that time
    \end{itemize}
    \item compute reception time of packet on other end of link
        \begin{itemize}
        \item schedule new event to handle packet being received at that time
        \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{action example 2}
\begin{itemize}
    \item take next packet on link 0 of switch
    \item compute next link for packet
    \item add packet to queue for next link

        \item to dequeue from next link (if not scheduled already)
