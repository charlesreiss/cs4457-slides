\begin{frame}{Tor}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Tor --- ``onion routing''
    \item suppose connecting from A to B and A to C
    \item goal: connection is anonymous
    \item method: proxy through several `onion routers'
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item attacker should only know:
        \begin{itemize}
        \item A is sending to someone via Tor
        \item B is receiving from someone via Tor
        \item C is receiving from someone via Tor
        \end{itemize}
    \item not be able to tie A and B or A and C or B and C together otherwise
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Tor threat model}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item (from Digledine, Mathewson, Syverson, ``Tor: A Second-Generation Onion Router'')
    \item an advserary ``who can observe some fraction of network traffic; who can generate, modify,
        delete, or delay traffic; who can operate onion routers of their own; and who can compromise some
        fraction of onion routers''
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Tor circuit idea}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item $E_X(Y)$ = Y encrypted to X
    \item to create `circuit': A $\rightarrow$ OR 1 $\rightarrow$ OR 2 $\rightarrow$ B
    \item A sends OR1 via TLS: \\
        ``please send OR2: '' + $E_{OR2}$(``please connect to B'')
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item OR1 doesn't know who A is sending to
    \item OR2 doesn't know who is sending to B
    \item fine if they're actually independently operated
    \item A can do more `layers' if desired
    \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{traffic analysis problem}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item problem 1: if I see A send 1000 bytes, then receive 1749 bytes, and\ldots
    \item at about the same time I see B receive 1000 bytes, then send 1749 bytes
    \item \ldots would be a big tell
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item worse: B or OR 1 or OR 2 can deliberately generate patterns of traffic to help ID A
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{mitigations for traffic analysis?}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item fixed-sized 512B `cells' sent between nodes
        \begin{itemize}
        \item padding added to full size
        \item lowers resolution of observed sizes
        \end{itemize}
    \item ``cover traffic'' sent periodically between A and OR1
        \begin{itemize}
        \item 1.5 s to 9.5 s in each direction if no traffic
        \item idea: hard for attacker to tell when user active
        \end{itemize}
    \item but real-time nature limits possible mitigations
        \begin{itemize}
        \item similar idea for email avoids with random delays
        \item \ldots but can't really browse the web that way
        \end{itemize}
