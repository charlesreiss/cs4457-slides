    \item suppose I have two racks of servers in two different buildings
    \item want them to be in the same subnetwork
        \begin{itemize}
        \item so they'll find each other with broadcast, multicast DNS
        \end{itemize}
    \item how should I do this if\ldots
        \begin{itemize}
        \item the two buildings are connected via Ethernet also used for internet access?
        \item the two buildings are connected via an IP link leased from an ISP?

    \item suppose I have a rack of servers in my building, but I'm migrating to the cloud
    \item I've moved one server to a cloud provider\ldots
    \item I don't want to reconfigure the other servers that talk to it\ldots
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item what would be some options to do this? what else do we need to know about the server?
    \item what would be useful features for cloud provider to give us?
