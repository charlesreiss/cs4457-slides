\begin{frame}{aside: non-end-to-end encryption?}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item often encapsulation used to have encrypted link
    \item nice, but really want to encrypt between end-hosts
        \begin{itemize}
        \item example: SSH, HTTPS
        \end{itemize}
    \item exercise: extra vulnerable points if relying on encrypted link idea?
    \end{itemize}
