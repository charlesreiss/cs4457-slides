\begin{frame}{firewall rules}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item simple idea: look at packet's fields
    \item table indicating whether to reject
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item similar idea to routing, but\ldots
    \item table matches fields other than destination
    \item table acitons are `drop', `reject', etc.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{``stateless'' firewall}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item this design: table is set once by sysadmin
    \item doesn't change based on connections, etc.
        \begin{itemize}
        \item might change based on manual reconfiguration, etc.
        \end{itemize}
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item called ``stateless''
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item firewall doesn't track `state' based on current activity
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{exercise: what info do we need}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item what fields do we need to match these
        \begin{itemize}
        \item (and/or can we not handle without something more stateful?)
        \end{itemize}
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item DNS queries to recursive DNS server from external servers
    \item packets with source address that does not match network
    \item from known malicious sources
    \item connecting from outside  to TCP servers not on allowlist
    \item connecting from inside using services (HTTP, etc.) not on allowlist
    \end{itemize}
