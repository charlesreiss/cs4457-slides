\begin{frame}{partial tables}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item dealing with full Internet routing table is expensive
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item common shortcut if you have a couple ISPs:
    \item keep `short' routes (example: short AS path)
        \begin{itemize}
        \item to one of your ``primary'' ISPs
        \item maybe using ECMP
        \end{itemize}
    \item have default route for other cases
        \begin{itemize}
        \item special route for 0.0.0.0/0, ::/0
        \item to one of your ISPs
        \end{itemize}
    \item take advantage of more specific routes beating less specific
        \begin{itemize}
        \item typically also true in OSPF, RIP, etc.
        \end{itemize}
