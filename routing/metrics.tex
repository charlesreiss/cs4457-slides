    \begin{itemize}
    \item want some way of saying how `good' link is
    \item typically ``cost''/``distance'' value (so lower is better)
    \item in practice, most commonly \[\frac{\text{constant}}{\text{bandwidth}}\]
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item could also try to:
        \begin{itemize}
        \item take financial costs into account
        \item take lantency into account
        \item take reliability into account
        \item spread flows out among more links
        \end{itemize}
