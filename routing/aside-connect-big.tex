\begin{frame}{connecting big networks?}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item some options:
        \begin{itemize}
        \item (which are basically the same as connecting parts of big network)
        \end{itemize}
    \vspace{.25cm}
    \item run a fiber between two buildings
        \begin{itemize}
        \item permitting and construction needed
        \end{itemize}
    \item pay for direct access to fiber someone else ran (``dark fiber'')
        \begin{itemize}
        \item burying one fiber costs similar to burying bundle, so spares
        \end{itemize}
    \item pay a telecom for a site-to-site connection
        \begin{itemize}
        \item ``gaurenteed'' bandwidth+latency between two sites
        \item may or may not use series of dedicated fibers
        \end{itemize}
    \item get space in common datacenter, pay datacenter operator for connection 
    \end{itemize}
