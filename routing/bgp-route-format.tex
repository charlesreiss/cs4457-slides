\begin{frame}{BGP route}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item adjacent routers share list of \textit{routes} with:
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item IP prefix (CIDR-style, basically)
    \item AS path --- list of autonomous system the route goes through
    \item next hop router (IP address)
    \item \textit{multi-exit discriminator}
        \begin{itemize}
        \item low value = this entrance to AS is better than others for these IPs
        \end{itemize}
    \item \textit{local preference} (internal-only)
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{AS path}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item used to detect routing loops
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item append your AS when sending route externally
    \item always ignore external routes with your AS in their AS path already
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
