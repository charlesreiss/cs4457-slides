    \begin{itemize}
    \item historically, no verification routes announced by ``owner'' of IP addresses
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item Internet Routing Registries --- database of AS to IP address
        \begin{itemize}
        \item used automatically to filter out mistakes
        \item (not really designed to resist malicious attacks)
        \end{itemize}
    \item some verify which IPs they should have with RIRs
        \begin{itemize}
        \item ``letter of agency/authority'' to delegate
        \end{itemize}
    \item effort to deploy RPKI --- public-key based scheme to verify routes
        \begin{itemize}
        \item checks that routes originated at correct AS
        \item doesn't verify intermediate ASes will forward correctly
        \end{itemize}
