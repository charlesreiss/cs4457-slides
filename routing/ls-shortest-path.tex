\begin{frame}{finding shortest paths}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item given full picture of network
    \item want to find all shortest paths from self 
        \begin{itemize}
        \item shortest `distance' = lowest sum of metric
        \end{itemize}
    \item only need next hop, but will compute whole path to find that
    \item assumption: everyone using shortest path
    \item usual solution: Dijkstra's algorithm
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
