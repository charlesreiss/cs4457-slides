\begin{frame}{backbone}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item OSPF area 0 is called ``backbone''
    \item border routers only summarize routes sent to backbone \textit{or}
        not obtained from other area border routers
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item means routing between areas must either:
        \begin{itemize}
        \item go through the backbone, or
        \item only go through one border router
        \end{itemize}
    \item makes loops not possible
    \end{itemize}
