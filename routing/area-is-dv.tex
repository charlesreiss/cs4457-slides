\begin{frame}{distance vector in link state?}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item summaries are distance vectors!
        \begin{itemize}
        \item area border routers just saying which networks + metric
        \end{itemize}
    \item idea: mix simpler distance vectors with more flexible link-state
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{but distance vector problems?}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item recall: count-to-infinity
    \item let's say areas A, B, C, D all connected to each other\ldots
    \item \ldots and area D goes offline:
    \item could packet for D loop area A to B to C to A to B to C to \ldots
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item<2-> OSPF solution: disallow this network configuration
    \end{itemize}
