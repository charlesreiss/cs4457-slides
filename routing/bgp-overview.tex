\begin{frame}{Border Gateway Protocol}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item protocol for sending routes between networks
    \item used whereever routers from different ASes connect
        \begin{itemize}
        \item ``EBGP''
        \end{itemize}
    \item used within AS to share routes out of AS internally
        \begin{itemize}
        \item ``IBGP''
        \end{itemize}
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item each router constructs list of routes to offer
    \item each router receives list of routes, exports to OSPF/etc.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{BGP connections}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item BGP connections made between routers
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item each router keeps track of set routes advertised by other
    \item command sent to add or withdraw specific routes
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item not like distance vector where we keep resending everything
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{BGP prefixes}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item routes sent via BGP called `prefixes'
    \item said to be ``announced'' from one router to another
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item because the network (e.g. 10.0.1.0/24) is the important part
    \item (and the next hop is implied by where prefix comes from) 
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
