\begin{frame}{Border Gateway Protocol}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item protocol for sending routes between networks
    \item used whereever routers from different ASes connect
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item each router constructs list of routes to offer
        \begin{itemize}
        \item obtained from OSPF or similar
        \item route list filtered by administrator's policy
        \end{itemize}
    \item each router receives list of routes, exports
        \begin{itemize}
        \item sent as routes in OSPF or similar
        \item route list filtered by administrator's policy
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{external/internal route sharing}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item AS wants to choose intelligently from all external options
    \item probably could do this with OSPF or similar, but\ldots
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item usually have internal BGP instances (``iBGP'') to share this
        \begin{itemize}
        \item make sure every router knows all the ways out
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
