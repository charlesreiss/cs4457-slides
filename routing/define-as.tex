\begin{frame}{autonomous system}
\begin{itemize}
    \item autonomous system (AS) --- one ``routing domain''
    \begin{itemize}
        \item typically = set of networks administrated by one organization
        \item decides what routing to use internally
        \item should be fully connected internally
    \end{itemize}
    \item scope of OSPF instance = one AS
    \item each AS can connect to other ASes
        \begin{itemize}
        \item well-defined protocol for sending routes to other ASes
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{AS numbers}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item for Internet routing, ASes are assigned numbers
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item assigned by IANA and RIRs (similar to IP addresses)
    \item originally 16-bit, now extended to 32-bit
    \item some private use / special AS numbers 
    \end{itemize}
