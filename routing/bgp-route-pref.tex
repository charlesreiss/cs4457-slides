\begin{frame}{preference between routes}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item first priority: always AS administrator's policy; otherwise
    typical tie-breaker:
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item \myemph<2>{smaller set of addresses}
    \item shorter AS path list
    \item lower AS number that the route came from
    \item lower ``multi-exit discriminator''
    \item  \ldots
    \end{itemize}
