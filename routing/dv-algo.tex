\begin{frame}{distance vector routing}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item each node keeps \textit{distance vector}
        \begin{itemize}
        \item distance to each other node (network)
        \item also which neighbor to go through to get that distance
        \end{itemize}
    \item periodically send distance vector to all neighbors
    \item when receiving distance vector from X, check
    \item ``would going through X give me a better distance?''
        \begin{itemize}
        \item if so, update distance + which neighbor
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
