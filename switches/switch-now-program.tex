\begin{frame}{an annoyance}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item traditionally, switches/routers have been `fixed function' specialized hardware
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item special hardware needed for multigigabit performance
    \item limited configuration options
    \item usually non-automated configuration
        \begin{itemize}
        \item login to each managed switch/router to change settings
        \item no standardization for configuration across vendors
        \end{itemize}
    \item little visibility into internal design
        \begin{itemize}
        \item even though switches/routers often running complicated programs
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{the historical situation}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item let's say I want to design a new extension to Ethernet
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item historical options if want to test/deploy it\ldots
        \begin{itemize}
        \item implement it in slow/low-capacity software/FPGA switch
        \item convince switch HW company to implement it + release new version of switches
        \item contort my modification to fit with switch features not intended for this use
            \begin{itemize}
            \item example: using VPN support to change path of frames on network
            \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
