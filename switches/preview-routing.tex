\begin{frame}{preview: routing}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item better ways to decide where to send packets
    \item \ldots but require coordinating between switches
        \begin{itemize}
        \item avoid loops
        \item choose between multiple paths
        \item avoid `flooding' for each new machine
        \end{itemize}
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item problem also very important for large networks\ldots
    \item \ldots like the Internet
    \item we will revisit it when we talk about IP routing
    \end{itemize}
