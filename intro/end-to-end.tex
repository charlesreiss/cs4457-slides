    system. Therefore, providing that questioned function as a feature of the communication
    system itself is not possible. (Sometimes

\begin{frame}{example: reliable file transfer}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item want to make sure correct data transferred
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item want to protect against:
        \begin{itemize}
        \item \myemph<2>{error in hardware/software on sending machine reading file}
        \item \myemph<2|3>{bits being flipped in memory on forwarding machine}
        \item communication system flipping bits in data
        \item \myemph<2>{hosts crashing during communication}

\begin{frame}{solution: end-to-end checks}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item want reliable transfer: compare final files (with hash or similar)

\begin{frame}{end-to-end in practice}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item ``narrow waist'' of IP doesn't provide many gaurnetees
        \begin{itemize}
        \item no gaurentees about reliable transmission, duplicate suppression, message order, \ldots
        \end{itemize}
    \item but try to provide good service (``best effort'')
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item in design: typically middle systems won't know/care about what's forwarded
        \begin{itemize}
        \item but many exceptions
        \end{itemize}
