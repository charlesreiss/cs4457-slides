    \begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{server} = entity that waits for + responds to \textit{clients}
    \item server:
        \begin{itemize}
        \item always-on
        \item well-known how to contact
        \end{itemize}
    \item client
        \begin{itemize}
        \item sometimes on
        \item only contacted by server responding to it
        \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{not client/server?}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item not everything fits into client/server neatly
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item sometimes something is both client and server
    \item sometimes no distinguished entities (``peer-to-peer'')
    \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{client/server and channels}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item can have channels without client/server model
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item but the interface sockets provide assume client/server
        \begin{itemize}
        \item (so you have to make something server-like to do peer-to-peer with sockets)
        \end{itemize}
