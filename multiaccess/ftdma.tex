\begin{frame}{wifi polling mode}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item wifi has rarely used ``polling'' mode
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item access point tells everyone when to transmit/not transmit
    \item periodically `poll' stations for more traffic
    \item can be mixed with periods allowing normal CSMA/CA
        \begin{itemize}
        \item carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance
        \end{itemize}
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item exercise: pro/con

\begin{frame}{deliberate scheduling}
\begin{itemize}
\item so far: 
    \begin{itemize}
    \item devices decide when to try to send or reply to requests
    \item one channel supporting one transmitter/receiver
    \end{itemize}
\vspace{.5cm}
\item alternate idea (cellular networks): divide
\item several available channels
    \begin{itemize}
    \item typically different frequencies
    \item signal encoding chosen to avoid interference between close frequencies
    \end{itemize}
\item slots within each time interval
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{central scheduler idea}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item `base stations' track active user devices
    \item users have bandwidth reservations
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item base stations send out schedule of slots every $\sim$ 0.1--1ms
    \item protocol for handoff between base stations
    \item devices send back quality feedback to aid scheduling
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{dealing with propagation delay}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item schedule of slots will also have time delays
    \item goal: compensate for propogation delay
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item base station needs to track estimate of propogation delay
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{dealing with new nodes}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item what about nodes without a reservation?
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item mobile base stations advertise a `random access channel'
    \item used for reserving extra resources later only
    \item use wifi-like contention here
    \edn{itemize}

\begin{frame}{exercise}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item central scheduling v carrier-sense
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item exercise: which handles better\ldots
        \begin{itemize}
        \item utilizing the most of the available bandwidth
        \item independently controlled access points/base stations
        \item communications between two nearby nodes
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
