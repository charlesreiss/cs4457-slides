    \begin{itemize}
    \item 50 $\mu s$ minimum interframe spacing
    \item 10 $\mu s$ slots after that if contention
    \item speed of light propogation
    \item need to detect channel quiet this time minimum before transmitting
    \item 11Mbps max bitrate; $\sim$288 minimum frame size
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item exercise: 50 $\mu s$ includes time for ACK --- maximum distance before too little?
    \item exercise: what distance before carrier sense not useful?
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{802.11b distance}
\begin{itemize}
\item 50 $\mu s$ around 15000 metres for signals in IFS
    \begin{itemize}
    \item implies max distance for ACKs not being squashed of 7500 meteres
    \end{itemize}
\item 10 $\mu s$ means signal goes approx. 3000 metres
    \begin{itemize}
    \item distance where we won't detect transmission in previous slot accurately
    \item won't be sufficient to have chosen different retransmission slots
    \end{itemize}
\item 288 bit frame/11 Mbit approx. 27 microsec to transmit
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{very long-distance wifi}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item people have done very long distance wifi
        \begin{itemize}
        \item parabolic dishes, more recent versions than 802.11b
        \end{itemize}
    \item increase ACK timeouts and/or turn off ACKs
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item Wifi records are point-to-point with very directional antennas
    \end{itemize}
