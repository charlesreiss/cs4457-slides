\begin{frame}{last time}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item more metrics
        \begin{itemize}
        \item measuring throughput, maybe transmission delay
        \end{itemize}
    \item performance of stop-and-wait
    \item sending mulitple at a time
    \item sliding window
        \begin{itemize}
        \item window = maximum number in flight
        \item sender window size --- maximum sent ahead of ACK
        \item receiver window size --- maximum accepted ahead of first missing
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{anonymous feedback}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item difficulty of framing assignment 
    \item time taken by TAs in office hours
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{framing assignment difficulty}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item more problematic than I expected
        \begin{itemize}
        \item (as of yesterday evening 60\% pass all of test.py)
        \end{itemize}
    \item will adjust grading to do more manual looks at code that fails test than originally planned
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item TA and I's impression of issues:
        \begin{itemize}
        \item should have had clear testing-without-test.py infrastructure
        \item seems like students spending more time without comparing what sender/receiver seeing than we expected (which we think is usually best way to diagnose bugs in this assignment)
        \item should have mode prominent explanation of use of bytearray to store bit-arrays (since Python has no real bit-array type)
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{assignment (1)}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item write sender/receiver
    \item Packet structure
        \begin{itemize}
        \item acknum (can be \texttt{None} or integer)
        \item seqnum
        \item data
        \item is\_end flag
        \item timestamp
        \end{itemize}
    \item simulated simple network with queuing
    \item call-me-on-timeout function w/ cancellation
    \item send messages reliably (one message/packet)
    \item send function indicates if you can accept more yet
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{assingment API notes}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item function to call to set timeout
    \item can store and use return value to cancel later
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item trace function to help with debug output
    \item where it outputs controlled by config.TRACE setting
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{assignment (2)}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item part 1: stop-and-wait [this week]
        \begin{itemize}
        \item one packet at a time
        \item schedule `timeout' to resend
        \item cancel timeout + send next if ack recv'd
        \item set timeout length using timestamps
        \item remember: set timestamp differently on resend
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{a scheduling note}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item I'm travelling this Friday and all of next week
    \item hopefully will have reasonable internet most of that time, but not optimistic
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item Prof Campbell will cover lectures
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{assignment (3)}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item part 2: sliding window [originally next week]
        \begin{itemize}
        \item fixed window size
        \item should have timeouts per packet
        \item okay not to have fast retransmit (resend on duplicate ACKs)
        \end{itemize}
    \item will move part 2 to be due after I come back
    \item part 3: basic congestion control [much later]
        \begin{itemize}
        \item set window size using additive increase/multiplicative decrease
        \item we haven't covered what this is/why it (kinda) works
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{upcoming P4 assignment}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item after reliablity part 2
    \item requires use of virtual machine image (or similar)
    \item originally had extra week when I was in town because I'm worried about VM issues
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item still worried about VM issues, if you have a situation that makes running VMs weird,
        let's make sure things work in advance
    \end{itemize}
