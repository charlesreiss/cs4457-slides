        \item 1-bit sequence number to detect out-of-date

\begin{frame}{stop-and-wait issues}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item two issues with stop-and-wait:
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item doesn't use close to full capacity of network
    \item not clear how to set timeouts
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{looking at metrics}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item several important metrics we'll care about
    \item (both for this and future topics)
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item<2-> \textit{throughput} and \textit{bandwidth} ($\sim$ how much capacity used/available)
    \item<2-> \textit{latency} and \textit{round-trip time} (RTT) ($\sim$ what timeouts needed)
    \item<2-> \textit{jitter} ($\sim$ safety margin for timeouts)
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{anonymous feedback}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item ``Can we get a virtual queue for OH? Or maybe even a Discord for hw assistance. Thank you''
        \begin{itemize}
        \item have discord setup, but don't seem to have TA interest in running remote office hours
        \item prefer Piazza for asynchronous help
        \end{itemize}
    \item ``\ldots it seems like on Panopto, you have been putting CSO2 videos in the same folder as Computer Networks. On top of that, I wish the titles were a little easier to read (something like Sept. 3th 2024 "Title of Lecture").\ldots''
        \begin{itemize}
        \item CSO2 videos in wrong folder was an error (means my CSO2 videos were missing from Panopto for CSO2 students)
        \item videoes also linked off schedule page
        \item automation I have means changing names is a bit less straightforward than usual
        \end{itemize}
