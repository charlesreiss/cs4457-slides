\begin{frame}{bandwidth / throughput}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item bandwidth / data rate: maximum rate we can send per unit time
        \begin{itemize}
        \item most commonly measuring the speed of a link
        \end{itemize}
    \item 1 gigabit/second = transmit 1 bit / nanosecond
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item throughput: acheived rate per unit time
        \begin{itemize}
        \item often lower than total bandwidth because of losses
        \item (we'll give several examples throughout the semester)
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
