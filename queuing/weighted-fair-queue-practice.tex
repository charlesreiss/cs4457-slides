    \begin{itemize}
    \item gets complex to calculate with lots of different flows
    \item so common to use various approximations
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item example: deficit round robin
        \begin{itemize}
        \item take turns betwen flows
        \item keep count of `extra turns' based on size/etc.
        \end{itemize}
