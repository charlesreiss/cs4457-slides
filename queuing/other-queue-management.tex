    \begin{itemize}
    \item algorithms that go beyond drop-tail, FIFO called \\
        ``active queue management''
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item many variations besides RED, fair queuing

\begin{frame}{changing random early detection?}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item some things seem suspicious in RED:
        \begin{itemize}
        \item moving average of queue length limits response time
        \item how moving average computed can matter
        \item doesn't choose specific target queue length
        \item choice of drops doesn't take fairness into account
        \end{itemize}
    \item various proposals to tweak and address these issues
    \end{itemize}
