\begin{frame}{due times/late policy}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item assignments usually due Friday @ 11:59pm

    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item unusual circumstances --- contact me
        \begin{itemize}
        \item can often grant exceptions/alternate arrangements
        \item more flexibility if contacted earlier
        \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{collaboration}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item quizzes, homeworks are individual
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item yes:
        \begin{itemize}
        \item review examples in textbook/lecture/etc.
        \item discuss high-level concepts (without detailed psuedocode for assignment, etc.)
        \item lookup up syntax/standard library documentation
        \end{itemize}
    \item no:
        \begin{itemize}
        \item sharing code/detailed psuedocode/answers
        \item getting code/etc. from web forums, LLMs, etc.
        \end{itemize}
    \item LLM rule of thumb: can ask LLM for things you'd ask classmate for
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{aside: selected standard python libraries}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{bisect} --- search/insert within sorted list

    \item \texttt{heapq} --- priority queue (using a heap)
    \item \texttt{struct} --- convert between integers and bytes and vice-versa
        \begin{itemize}
        \item \texttt{array} --- convert between integers and bytes in less flexible way
        \end{itemize}
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item not intending for you to reimplement common, non-networking tasks
    \item may grant exceptions to use other libraries/etc. for \textit{generic} tasks
    \end{itemize}
