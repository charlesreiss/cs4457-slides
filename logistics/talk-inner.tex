\begin{frame}\frametitle{homeworks preview (1)}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item framing --- transmit messages using bits in Python
    \item reliable1/2 --- stream of messages with automatic resending
    \item P4* --- forwarding messages locally
    \item AIMD* --- simulating variations on TCP
    \item packet scheduling --- prioritizing network traffic
    \item DV routing --- forwarding messages far
    \item DNS --- mapping names to addresses
    \item webserver
    \item wireless*
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{assignment infrastructure}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item most assignments in Python
    \item P4 --- requires some VM setup
        \begin{itemize}
        \item network/switch emulation software that really needs root on Linux
        \end{itemize}
    \item AIMD --- using C++ simulator
        \begin{itemize}
        \item goal: tweak and measure working TCP implementation
        \item mostly small modifications, \textit{shouldn't} need much C++ knowledge
        \item (the other obvious simulator is mainly in Tcl, which seems worse idea)
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{notable changes}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item AIMD assignment is new
        \begin{itemize}
        \item previous assignment was implementing simple congestion control
        \item (congestion control = avoiding overloading network)
        \item too many corner cases
        \item did not complement lecture material on modern congestion control
        \end{itemize}
    \item framing assignment has new test program
    \item maybe other changes, time-depending
        \begin{itemize}
        \item would like to rework wireless assignment
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{due times/late policy}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item assignments usually due Friday @ 11:59pm
        \begin{itemize}
        \item 90\% credit for submissions up to 72 hours late, no questions asked
        \end{itemize}
    \item quizzes usually due Tuesday @ 3:15pm
        \begin{itemize}
        \item done online, untimed, open notes/book
        \item late submissions not normally accepted (may discuss during lecture)
        \end{itemize}
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item unusual circumstances --- contact me
        \begin{itemize}
        \item can often grant exceptions/alternate arrangements
        \item more flexibility if contacted earlier
        \end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{collaboration}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item quizzes, homeworks are individual
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item yes:
        \begin{itemize}
        \item review examples in textbook/lecture/etc.
        \item discuss high-level concepts (without detailed psuedocode for assignment, etc.)
        \item lookup up syntax/standard library documentation
        \end{itemize}
    \item no:
        \begin{itemize}
        \item sharing code/detailed psuedocode/answers
        \item getting code/etc. from web forums, LLMs, etc.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{gen AI}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item rule of thumb: can ask things you could ask fellow students
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item no: having LLM write your code, your writeup, \ldots
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{aside: selected standard python libraries}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{bisect} --- search/insert within sorted list
    \item \texttt{collections}'s \texttt{deque} --- ordered list with fast insertion/deletion at both ends
    \item \texttt{heapq} --- priority queue (using a heap)
    \item \texttt{struct} --- convert between integers and bytes and vice-versa
        \begin{itemize}
        \item \texttt{array} --- convert between integers and bytes in less flexible way
        \end{itemize}
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item not intending for you to reimplement common, non-networking tasks
    \item may grant exceptions to use other libraries/etc. for \textit{generic} tasks
    \end{itemize}

    \begin{itemize}
    \item will attempt to record (but sometimes technical stuff happens)
