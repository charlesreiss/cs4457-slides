% FIXME: example of TCP in practice
    % FIXME: show packet trace mostly through wireshark screenshots
        % interleave with TCP format diagram from standard
    % mention I was doing large SSH transfer
    % look at client -> server packet from that transmission
    % note existence of Ethernet, IPv4 parts
    % look at TCP part
        % talk about flags
        % talk about sequence number, acknowledgment number
        % show window size, talk about calculation in packet format
        % show timestamp option

    % look at duplicate ACK -- wireshark search
        % show increasing SACK window

    % find retransmissions
        % look for trace with real retransmissions?

    % FIXME: get trace which is bandwidth limited --- from VM?

    % add ack/seq column, show

    % show ACK-only packet

% FIXME: show graphs
    % sequence number
        % include tight zoom to show sending window pattern
    % round-trip time

% FIXME: preview: congestion
