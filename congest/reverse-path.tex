\begin{frame}{the reverse path}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item so far: assuming congestion on sender to receiver path
    \item but we can also have congestion in other direction
        \begin{itemize}
        \item network becomes overloaded with ACKs
        \end{itemize}
    \item hopefully rare because ACKs are small, but\ldots
    \item but worth some special mitigations
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{delayed ACKs}
\begin{itemize}
\item RFC 1122 {\small(Requirements for Internet Hosts --- Communication Layers)}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item ``A host that is receiving a stream of TCP data segments can increase efficiency\ldots by sending fewer than one ACK (acknowledgment) per data segment received; this is known as a ``delayed ACK''\ldots ''
    \end{itemize}
\item usually enabled these days
\item adds some latency, so Linux lets you disable on per-connection basis
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
