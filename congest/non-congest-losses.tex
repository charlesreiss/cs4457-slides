\begin{frame}{non-congestion losses}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item we were ignoring non-congestion losses
    \item suppose \myemph{1\%} loss rate from transmission errors
    \item if huge bandwidth, 50 ms RTT
    \item with TCP heuristics (+1 packet/RTT, half on loss)\ldots
    \item normal window size? achieved bandwidth (pkts/sec)?
        \begin{itemize}
        \item<2-> window size increases for about 100 packets, then halves
        \item<2-> starting at window size 8:
        \item<2-> 8, 9 (17 total), 10 (27), 11 (38), 12 (50), 13 (63), 14 (77), 15 (92), 16 (>100)
        \item<2-> $\rightarrow$ window size fluctuates from around 8 to 16
        \item<3-> 12 pkts/50 ms = 240 pkts/sec
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{non-congestion losses and congestion control}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item significant non-congestion losses $\rightarrow$ very bad performance with most congestion control
    \item reason why wireless, etc. often does its own acknowledgements and resending
    \end{itemize}
