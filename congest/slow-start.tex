\begin{frame}{``slow start''}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item not very well named
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item problem is that additive increase doesn't find capacity quickly
    \item exponential(ish) increase to find \textit{initial} window size
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{``slow start'' on connection begin}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item set window size = 1 packet
    \item increase by one packet for each ACK
    \item \ldots until first packet loss
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item then revert to additive increase
        \begin{itemize}
        \item actually slower at increasing
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{``slow start'' later}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item keep track of window size after multiplicative decrease
    \item called \texttt{ssthresh}
        \begin{itemize}
        \item probably variable name in BSD code for this
        \end{itemize}
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item on timeout (not dupack), reset window size to 1 packet, BUT
    \item use `slow start' until ssthresh reached or more congestion
        \begin{itemize}
        \item backoff network more aggressively, and
        \item hopefully find correct new window size faster?
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
