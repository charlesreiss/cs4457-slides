\begin{frame}{slow start effect}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item suppose we never leave slow start in connection between A and B and:
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item A sends 4 packets to B
    \item after receiving 4 packets, B sends 8 packets to A
    \item after receiving those packets A sends 1 packet to B
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item how many round-trip times does this take?
    \end{itemize}
