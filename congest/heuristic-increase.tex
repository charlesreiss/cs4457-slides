\begin{frame}{slow increase}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item want to increase \textit{slowly} to avoid overload
    \item original TCP: +1 packet/round trip time
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item<2-> +1 certainly not optimal choice, but okay heuristic
    \item<2-> important theoretically: approx. \myemph{additive} increase
        \begin{itemize}
        \item helps ensure good behavior with multiple connections
        \item (we'll talk later about why)
        \end{itemize}
