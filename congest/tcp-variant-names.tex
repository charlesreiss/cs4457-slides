\begin{frame}{``traditional'' TCP variant names}
\begin{itemize}
\item everything we've talked about as standard = NewReno
\vspace{.5cm}
\item Tahoe --- slow start + redo slow start on any loss + fast retransmit
\item Reno --- Tahoe + halve window size on dup ACKs
\item NewReno --- Reno + fast recovery (send extra during fast retransmit)
\item SACK --- NewReno + use selective acknowledgments
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{more recent TCP variants}
\begin{itemize}
\item BIC, CUBIC --- loss-based schemes that vary increase/decrease algorithm
\item Vegas, BBR, FAST, Compound, Westwood --- schemes that use latency/bandwidth to detect congestion
    \begin{itemize}
    \item (later topic)
    \end{itemize}
\item (and there are many, many more)
