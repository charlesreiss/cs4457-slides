\begin{frame}{fast decrease (v2)}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item resetting window size to 1 is too slow
    \item compromise:
        \begin{itemize}
        \item loss detected without timeout: divide window size by two
        \item loss detected with timeout: decrease to 1
        \end{itemize}
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item<2-> exactly by two probably not important
    \item<2-> important theoretically: \myemph{multiplicative} decrease
        \begin{itemize}
        \item will help show okay behavior with multiple flows
        \end{itemize}
