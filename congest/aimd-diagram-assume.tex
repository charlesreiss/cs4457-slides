\begin{frame}{some assumptions we made}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item \ldots that are probably not true
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item both flows experience drops equally when network overloaded
        \begin{itemize}
        \item higher-bandwidth flow more likely to see drops?
        \item depends on how switches manage queues?
        \item depends on how `bursty' hosts are?
        \end{itemize}
    \item same additive increase factor (for 45 degree angle)
        \begin{itemize}
        \item TCP so far: +1 segment/round-trip-time
        \item round trip time, segment size may vary between flows
        \end{itemize}
