\begin{frame}{fairness metrics}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item would like to say both allocations are `fair'
    \item not equal, but most equal we can give on network
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item would like some way of formalizing this
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{fairness intuition}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item unfair allocation = someone gets much less than others
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item consequence: let's look for ``starved'' flow
    \item if we can add to starved flow\ldots \\
          without hurting more starved flows\ldots \\
          then that's ``unfair''
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
