\begin{frame}{fairness metrics}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item would like to say both allocations are `fair'
    \item easy when ideal allocation is equal, but that's not always the case
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item perhaps not equal, but most equal we can give on network
    \item would like some way of formalizing this
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{fairness intuition}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item unfair allocation = someone gets much less than others
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item consequence: let's look for ``starved'' flow
    \item if we can add to one flow\ldots \\
          and only hurt flows that are slower than it\ldots \\
          then that's ``unfair''
    \item idea called \textit{min-max fairness}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
